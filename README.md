# retrorama-icons
I've made these icons to change the original ones and give a new look, making them more like the theme itself. :)

#Install
Log in you pi through WINSCP or another FTP program and go to folder ./home/pi/RetroPie/retropiemenu/icons and copy the files there (make a backup of your old icons if you want them in the future)

Enjoy
